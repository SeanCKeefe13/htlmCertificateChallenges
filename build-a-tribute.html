        <div id="tribute-info">
            <p>Having met at such a young age and staying as close friends for decades, Cody's mind and outlook on life
                has always played a great role in shaping my perspective on the world. His interests in the sciences
                always
                inspired and enlightened me to possbilities and events at play all around us. From a very young age Cody
                would seek out knowledge for his own personal enjoyment, reading textbooks on chemistry and biology as a
                leisure
                read. Through out the beginning years of my education I would turn to him for advice and guidance over
                teachers and
                adult figures in my life, he had a way of explain things to me that always ended up clicking. There has
                been so few
                people in my life thats opinion matter to me as much as his.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cody is a fullstack software developer who through out his career has been a part of a handful of
                aspects in the industry;
                Working as a developer, training and coaching fellow employees, right up to team leadership and
                management. As i work through
                the different challenges that face me in my journey through learning software development his guidance,
                support and time has been
                invaluable to my ability to further my skills. Not only was he the one who I looked at and admired the
                challenging enviroment he
                would discuss but he was also the person who convinced me that despite the level of education I attained
                in my formative years
                had no bearing on my ability to grow, bettering my self and achieving more. As I write this very simple
                tribute based web page,
                there is no value placed on this page that would be possible without him as a friend, mentor and
                teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                To all the great years of friendship, and the adventures and challenges set ahead. I will always cherish
                his words, and reach
                for his assistance to overcome and thrive.

            </p>
